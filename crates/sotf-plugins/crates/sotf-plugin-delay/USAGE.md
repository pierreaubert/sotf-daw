# Delay

## Overview

An audio delay effect with adjustable delay time, feedback, and dry/wet mix. Use it for echo effects, slapback, doubling, or creative rhythmic patterns. Supports fractional-sample delay via four-point Lagrange interpolation.

## Features

### Delay Line

A feedback delay line that stores audio and plays it back after a configurable time. Feedback sends the delayed signal back into the buffer, creating repeating echoes that decay over time.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Range | Default | Unit | Description |
|-----------|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| Delay Time | 0.1 to 5000 | 100 | ms | Time between the dry signal and the first echo |
| Feedback | 0 to 95 | 30 | % | Amount of delayed signal fed back into the delay buffer. Higher = more repeats |
| Mix | 0 to 100 | 50 | % | Dry/wet blend. 0% = dry only, 100% = delayed only |

### Smooth Parameter Changes

Delay time, feedback, and mix are smoothed to avoid hard discontinuities during
real-time adjustment. The default delay-time path uses four-point Lagrange
interpolation with tape-style behavior, so automation or LFO modulation can
intentionally produce Doppler/pitch glide. The structural `pitch_preserving`
mode instead switches nonidentical delay targets through silence over 20 ms
while both read heads remain stationary; LFO rate and depth must be zero in
that mode.

The LFO uses bounded one-sided clamping at the minimum and maximum delay: the
feasible half-cycle remains active while only the portion outside the declared
delay range is clipped. Allpass enable/bypass and coefficient changes crossfade
over 20 ms, and the filter state runs continuously to avoid stale-tail clicks.

Per-channel mode is reserved for pure RoomEQ routing delays: mix is fixed wet,
feedback and LFO are zero, and allpass and pitch-preserving modes are disabled.
Its delay memory is sized from the declared per-channel automation maximum
rather than the global five-second effect range.

## Demos

### Demo: Slapback Echo

**Scenario:** Adding a single quick echo to a vocal or guitar for a rockabilly/vintage feel.
**Before:** Dry vocal or guitar track.
**After:** A single tight echo ~80 ms after each note, adding depth without clutter.
**Config:**
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 80.0,
  "feedback": 0.0,
  "mix": 0.3
}
```

### Demo: Rhythmic Echo

**Scenario:** Creating a rhythmic delay pattern synced to a tempo (e.g., 120 BPM = 500 ms per beat).
**Before:** A synth lead or percussion loop.
**After:** Repeating echoes that decay over several beats, creating rhythmic interest.
**Config:**
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 500.0,
  "feedback": 0.5,
  "mix": 0.4
}
```

### Demo: Ambient Wash

**Scenario:** Long delay with high feedback for ambient/drone textures.
**Before:** A simple sustained sound or pad.
**After:** Dense, evolving echoes that build into an ambient wash.
**Config:**
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 1200.0,
  "feedback": 0.8,
  "mix": 0.6
}
```

## Presets

### Slapback
**Use case:** Quick single echo for vocals, guitar, snare
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 80.0,
  "feedback": 0.0,
  "mix": 0.3
}
```
**Tips:** Keep feedback at 0 for a single reflection. Adjust delay between 50-120 ms to taste.

### Stereo Doubling
**Use case:** Subtle thickening effect
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 20.0,
  "feedback": 0.0,
  "mix": 0.5
}
```
**Tips:** Very short delays (10-30 ms) create a chorus/doubling effect rather than a distinct echo.

### Quarter Note Echo (120 BPM)
**Use case:** Rhythmic delay synced to tempo
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 500.0,
  "feedback": 0.4,
  "mix": 0.35
}
```
**Tips:** Adjust delay time to match your tempo: delay_ms = 60000 / BPM for quarter notes.

### Long Ambient Tail
**Use case:** Ambient textures and soundscapes
```json
{
  "delay_ms": 2000.0,
  "feedback": 0.75,
  "mix": 0.5
}
```
**Tips:** Feedback above 0.8 creates very long decay — be careful not to build up to clipping.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Feedback is capped at 95% to prevent infinite buildup and clipping.
- For tempo-synced delays: quarter note = 60000/BPM ms, eighth note = 30000/BPM ms.
- Use mix at 100% in a send/return configuration; use 20-50% when inserted directly.
- Very short delays (< 30 ms) create comb filtering / chorus effects rather than distinct echoes.
- Delay time changes are smoothed — you can automate delay time without clicks.
