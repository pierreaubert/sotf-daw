/// 1. Ear canal resonance: broad +10 dB peak at ~2.7 kHz
/// 2. Concha resonance: broad +5 dB peak at ~4.5 kHz
/// 3. Pinna anti-resonance: narrow -6 dB notch at ~9 kHz (elevation cue)

/// Without these cues, XTC output tends to sound "inside the head" even with
/// perfect crosstalk cancellation. Returns a real-valued gain (applied to both
/// ipsilateral and contralateral transfer functions).
