# 0.5.42

## Performance

- Split wrapped overlap-add writes into two modulo-free regions and drain the
  interleaved output ring with at most two contiguous copy/clear operations.
- Add streaming Criterion coverage for 2/3/8/16 outputs and host blocks below,
  at, and above the 512-frame hop. On the review machine the retained kernel
  improved 2/3/8-output callbacks by about 24–27%, 16 outputs from about 90 to
  73 microseconds, and stereo 128/512/2048-frame blocks by about 13–20%.

## Testing

- Compare wrapped, nonzero-offset OLA accumulation exactly with the former
  scalar modulo-ring formula. A drain matrix covers tail/interior positions,
  before/at/across-wrap lengths, 2/3/8/16 channels, exact copied output, cleared
  samples, untouched sentinels, and the next read position.

# 0.5.41

## Fixes

- Coalesce rapid geometry/head automation through one latest-request worker per
  instance instead of spawning unbounded jobs on Rayon's global pool.
- Make source mode, HRTF, room IR, and roomEQ matrix structural; callback
  adoption accepts same-width updates only.
- Consolidate runtime, factory, serde/preset, and generated UI parameters on
  `XtcPluginParams`; align defaults and make shadow cutoff/slope effective.
- Decode integer and floating-point PCM room-IR WAVs and reject corruption,
  unsupported channel counts, and silently truncated long IRs.
- Replace the redundant integrated effort pass with a per-frequency
  loudspeaker-row power constraint.
- Separate validation oracles from production helpers and reject non-finite
  validation measurements.

## Testing

- Added coalescing-worker, structural-layout, parameter parity/preset,
  cutoff/slope response, PCM16/long-IR, effort-power, and non-finite validation
  regressions.

# 0.5.40

## Fixes

- Source-mode and HRTF-path parameter changes are now validated as a complete
  configuration before they are committed. Missing or invalid HRTF artifacts,
  and contradictory synthetic/HRTF state, return an error without leaving the
  visible parameters ahead of the active filters.

# 0.5.39

## Fixes

- Brown–Duda plant construction now applies the contralateral ITD once; the
  geometric path phase owns delay while Brown–Duda contributes magnitude.
- Source modes are checked at construction: synthetic mode cannot silently
  consume an HRTF path, and HRTF mode requires an explicit file.
- RoomEQ output width is declared configurable in the plugin catalog so graph
  metadata matches recommended matrices with more than two speaker outputs.
- Room IR loading now reports packet read errors instead of treating truncated
  input as EOF.

# 0.5.38

## Fixes

- Corrected host latency reporting to one full FFT frame. Streamed impulse
  measurements showed that the previous `fft_size - hop_size` value
  under-compensated at host block sizes smaller than the STFT hop.

# 0.5.37

## Fixes (from code review 2026-05-11)

### Fixed
- **Air absorption documentation and coverage** (`reflections.rs`, `tests.rs`): Kept the
  conservative quadratic dB/m fit after checking the review's proposed `5e-7 * f^1.5`
  replacement, and added a regression assertion for the documented 8 kHz / 5 m value.
- **Denormal regression test** (`tests.rs`): Corrected the test to count only IEEE-754
  subnormal values below `f32::MIN_POSITIVE`; small normal values such as `1e-35`
  are intentionally preserved by `flush_denormals_inplace`.
- **Room reflection pressure coefficient** (`reflections.rs:119`): amplitude now uses
  `sqrt(1 - wall_absorption)` (pressure reflection coefficient) instead of
  `(1 - wall_absorption)` (energy coefficient). For α = 0.3 the reflected amplitude
  changes from 0.70 to 0.84; results in correctly estimated reflected energy.
- **HRTF sample-rate guard** (`lib.rs:119`): SOFA files without a `DataSamplingRate`
  attribute are now rejected with an error rather than silently accepted, preventing
  spectral feature shifts (e.g., a 44.1 kHz SOFA at 48 kHz shifts all notches by ~8.8 %).
- **`compute_2x2_inverse` determinant guard** (`filters.rs:836`): threshold changed from
  absolute `1e-10` to relative `1e-10 * diag`, preventing false-positive singularity
  detection when transfer-function magnitudes are small (e.g., deep notches with |H| ~ 1e-3).
- **Frequency-domain crossfade** (`lib.rs:process_stft_frame`): stereo and speaker-mode
  crossfades now blend prev/current filters per frequency bin and run a single IFFT per
  channel, halving IFFT cost from 4 to 2 per hop during crossfades. Correctness is
  preserved by IFFT linearity.
- **`latency_samples`** (`lib.rs:1809`): now reports `fft_size - hop_size` (= 3/4 of
  fft_size for 75 % overlap) instead of `fft_size`, saving `hop_size` samples of
  unnecessary host-side latency compensation.

### Deferred
- **Brown-Duda `alpha_min` comment** (review §1.1): review says to "correct or document";
  the function already documents this as a simplified approximation. Adding published
  curve comparison tests deferred as cross-crate benchmark work.
- **`explicit_delay` unity amplitude at LF** (review §1.4): the ~0.3 dB error for
  typical geometry is below audibility threshold; deferred.
- **Condition-number double-counting of beta frequency boosts** (review §2.3): requires
  architectural changes to the filter computation pipeline; deferred.
- **COLA output_scale correctness** (review §2.4): requires verifying `generate_hann_window`
  window type in `sotf-host`; deferred as cross-crate.
- **Dual parameter struct consolidation** (review §4.1, §4.2, §4.3): cross-crate refactor;
  deferred.
- **`compute_room_params_hash` over-invalidation** (review §4.4): medium risk change to
  caching logic; deferred.
- **`build_reflection_data_ir` missing end window** (review §4.5): enhancement; deferred.
- **STFT COLA perfect-reconstruction test** (review §4.6): deferred.
- **`flush_denormals_inplace` SIMD** (review §4.7): optimization in `sotf-host`; deferred.

# 0.5.36

- Added `source_mode = "roomeq_recommended"` with
  `recommended_matrix_file`, allowing the plugin to load RoomEQ
  `recommended_xtc_matrix.json` FIR artifacts instead of recomputing filters
  from synthetic geometry or HRTF data.
- RoomEQ recommended matrices are validated before activation: invalid JSON,
  sample-rate mismatches, and missing filters are rejected instead of silently
  falling back to synthetic filters; matrices with two or more speaker outputs
  expose the matching plugin output channel count.
- RoomEQ recommended processing now maps stereo ear-intent input to N speaker
  outputs with dynamic overlap-add buffers, bypass handling, limiter coverage,
  and no stereo-only AutoGain assumptions for multichannel matrices.
- Fixed RoomEQ matrix tap orientation for the off-diagonal paths and added
  regression coverage for asymmetric recommended matrices.
- Async filter recompute now builds room/HRTF/filter data off-thread, publishes a pending generation, and starts the crossfade only when process() adopts the completed update.
- Large process calls are chunked through preallocated scratch buffers, so the hot path no longer resizes for offline-sized blocks.
- Unwritten output tail is zeroed before return.
- Brown-Duda now returns a complex head-shadowing gain and applies its phase in both symmetric and asymmetric plant paths.
- Added coverage proving Brown-Duda contributes a phase term.
