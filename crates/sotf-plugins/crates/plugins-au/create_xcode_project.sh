# Generate the Xcode project for SOTF Audio Units.
#
# The Xcode project is no longer hand-built — it's generated from project.yml
# by xcodegen. The build recipes (just build-au-all, etc.) call xcodegen
# automatically when project.yml is newer than the generated .xcodeproj, so
# you typically don't need to run this script directly.
#
# See:
#   - QUICKSTART.md — 5-minute setup
#   - README.md     — overview and per-arch flow
#   - SETUP_GUIDE.md — full architecture
#
# Run this script if you want to (re)generate the project right now without
# kicking off a build.
