# sotf-plugin-eq

SOTF EQ plugin with parametric biquad, warped biquad, and Kautz modal filters.

Parametric equalizer supporting multiple filter types (peak, shelf, highpass, lowpass, etc.) with optional auto-gain normalization. Standard filters use cascaded biquads; advanced Roomeq paths can also load per-band `topology: "warped_biquad"` and `topology: "kautz_filter"` entries.
