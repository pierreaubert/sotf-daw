## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Add serialization/deserialization round-trip tests for `MidiMapping`,
  `ValueScaling`, `ControllerLayout`, `MappingTemplate`, `MidiDeviceInfo`, and
  `MidiDeviceSnapshot`.
- Add tests for invalid MIDI input events: out-of-range/malformed messages,
  unknown control IDs, wrong-channel messages, unsupported message types, and
  stale parameter indices in mappings.
- Add tests verifying safe behavior when configured MIDI devices are absent on
  launch (`MidiManager::with_config`, `connect_input_by_name`,
  `connect_output_by_name`).
- Add hot-plug simulation tests for duplicate device names and reconnection
  with the same name but a different port index.
- Add `RELEASE_NOTES.md` documenting supported MIDI behavior for release and
  expand the README with the same statement.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Add stack-sized `MidiMessage::System` for MIDI system common and real-time messages.
- Add non-mutating MIDI device enumeration helpers.
- Add checked template-to-mapping conversion and allocation-free MIDI region iterators.

### Fixed
- Reject channel messages whose data bytes have the status bit set instead of masking malformed input.
- Reassemble split SysEx input packets before dispatching MIDI callbacks.
- Avoid duplicate control bindings when manual overrides or MIDI learn remap an existing control.
- Ignore stale templates whose `param_index` exceeds the focused plugin's parameter list.
- Identify Launch Control XL arrow buttons as CC controls.
- Validate RME TotalMix bank usage consistently and send Mackie mute/solo buttons as NoteOn/NoteOff press pairs.
- Make auto-map unit matching case-insensitive for frequency parameters and clarify zero-control paging.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-05-13

### Fixed
- Did a round of test fixing.

### Changed
- Large commit with significant improvements to the host: timeline & clip
  sequencing, multi-track recording, sample-accurate automation, latency
  compensation v2, MIDI sequencing, sidechain routing v3, non-destructive
  editing, offline bounce, VST/AU hosting. First step of automatic UI
  generation via a set of constraints; non-regression is built in with `insta`.
