// AudioSink trait - Abstraction for audio output destinations
// ============================================================================
//
// The current standalone implementation is cpal hardware output. The trait is
// the extension point for future backends; PipeWire, AirPlay, and Chromecast
// are not implemented sink variants.

/// Implementations handle the final step: getting f32 PCM samples to hardware
/// or a network endpoint. The playback thread's main loop handles frame
/// management (channel conversion, flush/drain sequencing, diagnostics) and
/// delegates the actual output to this trait.
///
/// # Real-time safety
/// `write()` must not allocate or acquire contended locks. Pre-allocate
/// all buffers during `open()` / `reconfigure()`.
