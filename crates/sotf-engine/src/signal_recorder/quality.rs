//! Per-take measurement-quality gate and clock-drift handling (R5).
//!
//! After a sweep take passes the capture gates (silence, clipping, cancel —
//! see `record.rs`), this module provides:
//!
//! - a hard **lag-lock gate** ([`check_lag_lock`]): if the cross-correlation
//!   between reference and capture has no confident peak, the take is
//!   refused instead of being analyzed at an arbitrary lag;
//! - **clock-drift decisions** ([`drift_action`]): split DAC/ADC clock setups
//!   (e.g. a USB mic against an interface output) accumulate lag over the
//!   sweep; large drift is corrected via
//!   `math_audio_dsp::analysis::correct_clock_drift`, very large drift
//!   additionally flags the take;
//! - the per-take quality report ([`build_capture_quality`]) carried back to
//!   callers inside [`CaptureAnalysis`].
