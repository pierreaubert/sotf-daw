# 1.0.32-33

## CoreAudio output stability

- On macOS, elevate the HAL decoder and playback feeder to the engine's soft audio-work QoS class while leaving CoreAudio's hard realtime callback policy under CPAL ownership. This prevents unrelated filesystem or UI load from starving the producer stages without changing Linux/Windows scheduler policy.
- Open the smallest advertised native CoreAudio channel layout when a device does not advertise the requested layout, while keeping the DSP graph's logical channel count independent and zero-filling unused hardware channels. This prevents stereo graphs from stalling devices such as EVO8 that expose a native six-channel stream.

## Transactional structural host updates

- Added a shared prepare/validate/commit protocol for plugin-chain and graph
  replacements. Complete hosts, analyzer cache slots, and latency-alignment
  storage are now prepared on the control side before the processing thread
  receives an infallible move-only candidate.
- Reject stale prepared candidates transactionally without replacing the
  working host, and report old/new latency plus an explicit change flag in the
  commit acknowledgement.
- Crossfade same-rate latency changes after delaying the shorter path; retain
  the existing old-to-silence-to-new transition for output-rate changes where
  samples cannot be blended one-for-one.
- Route replaced hosts and completed transition buffers to the bounded engine
  GC queue so plugin state is reclaimed off the processing thread.

# 1.0.31 (unreleased)

- Carry PND's optional absolute pilot/reference frequency through typed engine
  settings, defaults, parameter accessors, and plugin configuration conversion.

## Loudness analyzer channel layouts

- Pass a known output speaker configuration to output loudness analyzers after
  upmix, AAE, ambisonics decode, binaural decode, downmix, or mono-to-stereo.
- Keep the input analyzer count-only and invalidate layout knowledge after
  arbitrary matrix, band-split, or band-merge routing instead of guessing
  channel roles.

# 1.0.30 (unreleased)

## Release QA

- Fixed `crates/sotf-engine/Justfile` so `just qa-engine` passes `--test-threads=1` as a libtest argument (after `--`) rather than a cargo argument; the recipe now reaches the e2e audio tests.
- Added focused engine-manager integration tests for EOF transition,
  44.1 kHz source → 48 kHz device sample-rate mismatch, and high-gain plugin
  output clamping survival.

## Release P1 engine hardening

- Plugin-chain and plugin-graph host construction now runs on named builder
  threads before the processing-thread host swap, keeping the expensive build
  work off the manager thread while preserving existing ACK/rollback ordering.
- Playback audio threads on macOS now try `THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY`
  first and fall back to user-interactive QoS if the kernel rejects the
  request; processing threads keep the safer QoS path.
- Added regression coverage that cached engine reads avoid the manager
  command-lock path and that playback priority uses the macOS
  time-constraint policy path.

## Playback device selection

- Explicitly selected virtual/loopback output devices are now honored instead
  of rejected before device lookup. Virtual-output detection remains a default
  selection guard, but selecting the SOTF virtual output deliberately no longer
  blocks playback.
- The virtual-output diagnostic is now a debug hint rather than a user-visible
  error when an explicit output selection reaches the playback sink.

# 1.0.28

## Engine review regression hardening

- Added regression coverage for the P0-P2 engine review findings, including
  decoder backpressure interruption, decoder frame-buffer recycle misses,
  render-path allocation guards, MIDI event iteration, callback error event
  throttling, signal-recorder ring-buffer usage, manager mutex poisoning, and
  iOS playback feeder bulk writes.
- Made silent-source decoder frame sends interruptible under downstream
  backpressure so `Stop`/`Shutdown` commands cannot wedge behind a full queue.
- Prepared audio-track decoders during `build()` and reused them across seeks so
  `render_block` no longer opens decoders or allocates active-index vectors.
- Added non-allocating MIDI event visitor APIs and switched MIDI track rendering
  to use them instead of allocating per-block event vectors.
- Replaced signal-recorder CPAL callback per-sample ring pushes with chunked
  ring-buffer commits, and promoted input stream errors to rate-limited warnings.
- Rate-limited CPAL/playback stream-error event formatting and sending from
  callback paths.
- Recovered engine-manager mutex poisoning instead of panicking public state
  accessors and serialized command paths.
- Added decoder-local spare frame buffers and processing scratch-buffer helpers
  to remove reviewed hot-path allocation fallbacks.
- Updated the iOS playback feeder to bulk-copy frame data into `rtrb` chunks.

# 1.0.27

## Engine review P0-P2 hardening

- Added engine-side rate-limited logging helpers, matching the pattern used in
  `sotf-host`, and applied them to hot/error paths in playback, CPAL sink,
  decoder stream events, device polling, audio input overruns, plugin channel
  updates, matrix presets, and recorder mismatch diagnostics.
- Removed blocking mutex use from `signal_recorder` CPAL callbacks by routing
  captured samples through lock-free `rtrb` rings and atomics.
- Replaced decoder-thread hot-path unwrap/expect invariants with structured
  errors for missing decode buffers and resamplers.
- Made `PluginChain` track configurable input channel counts instead of
  assuming stereo when updating channel-dependent plugins.
- Downgraded normal engine-manager creation summaries from warning to info.
- Logged decoder stream send/join failures instead of silently discarding them.
- Logged playback/manager shutdown command drops, thread join panics, playback
  events, and recycled-buffer send failures instead of silently discarding them.
- Downgraded normal playback/manager operational status logs, including
  channel negotiation, stream rebuild success, and plugin-update queue/apply
  status, while keeping failures and recovery warnings at warning/error levels.
- Expanded verified output sample-rate caching from a single entry to a keyed
  per-device/per-channel cache, and filtered verification candidates against
  advertised device sample-rate ranges before building test streams.
- Exported the timeline module from `sotf-engine`, added the MIDI dependency
  required by timeline MIDI tracks, and exposed the MIDI sequencer API from
  `sotf-midi`.
- Added a local timeline instrument interface for MIDI tracks so timeline
  tests compile cleanly against the current plugin host API.
- Exported project persistence from `sotf-engine`, rebuilt MIDI tracks from
  saved `test_synth` configs, preserved timeline plugin-chain provenance for
  audio, MIDI, and master tracks, and added project bridge roundtrip coverage.
- Cached per-clip dB-to-linear gain conversion while still tracking direct
  public `gain_db` edits, fixed punch-out state after partial recording
  blocks, and pinned same-sample MIDI event ordering with regression coverage.
- Replaced the audio-input callback's per-sample ring-buffer pushes with the
  same `rtrb` bulk-copy chunk path used by playback output.
- Promoted decoder-thread and decoder-stream failure diagnostics from debug-only
  logging to rate-limited warnings.

## Engine playback transparency and gapless fixes

- Preserved pending decoder frames when `QueueNext` or `CancelNext` arrives
  during downstream backpressure, preventing frame drops near gapless
  transitions.
- Emitted final partial decoder frames at end-of-stream instead of dropping
  non-`frame_size` tails.
- Preserved compatible decoder/resampler staging across gapless transitions so
  same-format queued sources can continue without truncating the current tail.
- Added manager-side channel-count validation for local-file queued gapless
  sources without opening URL streams on the control thread.
- Stopped clamping f32 output at unity volume; integer output still clamps
  before hardware-format conversion.
- Replaced decoder hot-path front `Vec::drain` usage with cursor-backed sample
  queues.

# 1.0.26

## Added a way to cancel a running recording

- Public CancelFlag = Arc<AtomicBool> type and stable CANCELLED_ERR = "cancelled" sentinel string.
- probe_channel_delays_with_recording and run_spl_calibration gained a trailing cancel: Option<CancelFlag> parameter.
- The flag is threaded through probe_channel_delays_core → play_per_channel_and_record_mono, where it is checked:
    a. before any device setup,
    b. before kicking off playback (after the input stream is built),
	c. each iteration of the ~50 ms stability poll loop.
- Sibling probe_channel_delays and run_bass_anchor keep their existing public signatures and pass None internally.
- All three call sites (app-gpui/components/recording/probe.rs, spl_calibration.rs, and app-tui/events/conf_recordings.rs) updated to pass None for now — wiring an actual UI Stop button into a stored CancelFlag is the follow-up UI task.

# 1.0.25

## Engine threading and low-latency fixes

- Serialized `AudioEngine` command/response round trips so concurrent
  callers cannot consume each other's manager responses.
- Fixed plugin graph hot-reload acknowledgements and playback channel
  reconfiguration when graph output channel counts change.
- Moved playback underrun event reporting out of the cpal data callback
  and into the playback feeder thread.
- Reduced full-queue backoff in decoder/processing handoff paths from
  5 ms to 1 ms for lower-latency recovery from transient backpressure.
- Reused recycled buffers for HAL passthrough frames instead of
  allocating a fresh vector every frame.

# 1.0.24

## Driver HAL streaming reliability

- Driver-mode playback now retries `HalInputReader` setup after startup so a
  late-created HAL shared-memory file no longer leaves the engine permanently
  streaming silence.
- Added explicit driver-format startup helpers so HAL playback can use the
  daemon-provided sample rate and input channel count instead of assuming
  stereo 48 kHz input.
- Added regression coverage through `driver-hal`'s streaming guard tests for
  the late-HAL-reader reconnect path.

# 1.0.23

## GD-Opt v2 — Phase GD-1e.5: SPL calibration capture

Adds `run_spl_calibration` — plays a single-frequency reference tone
(1 kHz default) on one output channel while recording the mic, then
returns peak + RMS sample levels over the stable portion of the
tone. The UI uses the paired `(rms_sample_level, reported_db_spl)`
to derive `SplCalibration::spl_offset_db`, the GD-Opt v2 anchor for
the `sweep_level_db_spl` target (see `docs/gd_opt_v2_plan.md` §2.6
and §2.11 Q4).

- New public API `run_spl_calibration(output_channel, sample_rate,
  reference_freq_hz, amp, duration_s, out_dev, in_dev, input_channel)
  -> Result<SplCalibrationResult, _>`.
- New public type `SplCalibrationResult { sample_rate,
  peak_sample_level, rms_sample_level, reference_freq_hz,
  output_channel }`. Derives Debug/Clone/Serialize/Deserialize so
  sotf-player can re-export and carry it on the TUI+GPUI state
  structs.
- Reuses the existing `play_per_channel_and_record_mono` helper
  (from 1.0.22's dedup) so all device-discovery + cpal logic stays
  single-source. The calibration-specific logic is just (a) gen a
  pure tone via `gen_tone`, (b) after capture, slice a stable
  analysis window skipping 200 ms of attack/release on each end,
  (c) compute peak+RMS over that window.
- Input validation: rejects non-finite / non-positive freq, too-
  short duration (< 0.3 s), amplitude outside (0, 1].

# 1.0.22

## GD-Opt v2 — Phase GD-1e dedup: shared playback scaffolding

Refactor-only, no behaviour change. The ~400-line device-discovery +
playback + mic-capture block that `probe_channel_delays_core` and
`run_bass_anchor_core` had each been carrying is now a single
`play_per_channel_and_record_mono` helper.

- New private helper: `play_per_channel_and_record_mono(channel_indices,
  sample_rate, signal, silence_duration_ms, output_device_name,
  input_device_name, input_channel, log_tag)` returns a
  `PlayPerChannelOutput` with `recorded`, `input_sr`, per-channel
  `analysis_offsets` at `input_sr`, plus `analysis_signal_samples` and
  `analysis_silence_samples`. `log_tag` prefixes log lines so probe and
  bass-anchor captures stay distinguishable in logs.
- `probe_channel_delays_core` now delegates everything up to the
  cross-correlation analysis to the helper. Went from ~440 lines to
  ~170 lines. Regenerates the narrowband probe at `input_sr` when cpal
  negotiated a different rate — same logic, same behaviour, just
  relocated below the helper call.
- `run_bass_anchor_core` is similarly thinned. Went from ~265 lines
  to ~90 lines. Feeds the helper output straight into
  `analyze_bass_anchor_recording`.
- Net: `signal_recorder.rs` drops 142 lines (354 insertions, 496
  deletions for a single commit).

# 1.0.21

## GD-Opt v2 — Phase GD-1e: bass anchor capture

Implements the BassAnchor wizard step runner per
`docs/gd_opt_v2_plan.md` §2.6. The step plays a low-frequency tone
burst (20 Hz × 5 cycles by default) per channel, records the mic,
and extracts per-channel phase + half-split stability of the
burst's fundamental. GD-Opt v2 uses this as a hard anchor on the
first measured bin of the sweep phase to eliminate the 2π
wraparound ambiguity at sub-100 Hz.

- New `run_bass_anchor` / `run_bass_anchor_with_recording` entry
  points (public, non-iOS). Playback scaffolding mirrors
  `probe_channel_delays` — sequential single-channel bursts with
  silence gaps, mic recording to a mono `f32` WAV, single DFT-based
  per-channel phase extraction.
- New `analyze_bass_anchor_recording` helper — the pure analysis
  core, used both by the live runner and by the replay tests. Can
  be called offline against a persisted bass-anchor WAV to
  re-derive per-channel phase without replay.
- New `BassAnchorResults` / `BassAnchorChannelResult` types. Each
  channel carries `bass_anchor_phase_deg`, `bass_anchor_magnitude`,
  and `bass_anchor_stability_deg`. Values ≥ 20° on the stability
  metric trigger the `"bass_anchor_unreliable"` advisory
  (`docs/gd_opt_v2_plan.md` §2.8).
- Three new replay tests pin behaviour:
  `bass_anchor_replay_recovers_known_phase_shifts` (phase recovery
  within ±2° across three synthetic channels),
  `bass_anchor_replay_rejects_length_mismatch`, and
  `bass_anchor_replay_errors_when_start_past_eof`.

# 1.0.20

## GD-Opt v2 — Phase GD-1a.1: Drop legacy recording migration

Removes the V1 → V2 recording migration path per the "no back-compat"
decision recorded in
[`crates/autoeq/docs/gd_opt_v2_plan.md`](../autoeq/docs/gd_opt_v2_plan.md)
§2.10 (row **GD-1a.1**) and §2.11 Q6.

**Breaking:** the following public items are removed from
`sotf_audio::signal_recorder` and from the top-level `lib.rs`
re-exports:

- `LegacyRecordingResult` (struct)
- `LegacyChannelRecording` (struct)
- `LegacyRecordingSession` (struct)
- `migrate_legacy_recording` (function)
- `write_extended_csv` (private helper; had no callers after the
  migration function was deleted)

Pre-GD-Opt-v2 `recordings.json` files can no longer be loaded by
sotf-engine. A typed error variant
(`AutoeqError::UnsupportedRecordingFormat`) is reserved in the
`autoeq` crate (v0.4.33) for the loader integration that lands in a
later GD-Opt v2 phase; users with legacy sessions must re-record.

A pre-removal sweep (`grep -rn "migrate_legacy_recording|Legacy\
RecordingSession" crates/ --include="*.rs"`) confirmed no external
callers outside sotf-engine itself. The local struct of the same
name in `crates/autoeq/bin/convert_recording.rs` is unrelated — it
defines its own `LegacyRecordingResult` in the converter binary and
never imported the engine's version.
